Crypto Wallet Transactions Tracker Bot
</h1>


This is a Telegram bot that tracks the transactions of added Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) wallets and sends notifications whenever a new transaction occurs. The bot uses the Etherscan and BSCscan APIs to gather information about transactions, and CoinGecko to fetch the current prices of ETH and BNB.

## Commands

- `/start` shows a welcome message and instructions on how to use the bot.
- `/add` adds a new wallet to track transactions for. The wallet address must be provided in the correct format (starting with '0x' for ETH wallets and 'bnb' for BNB wallets), otherwise the bot will prompt the user to correct it. The added wallets are saved in a JSON file for persistence.
- `/remove` removes a wallet from the list of tracked wallets. The user must provide the wallet address in the correct format.
- `/list` shows the list of currently tracked wallets.
